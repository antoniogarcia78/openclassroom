    In a previous exercise, you created three instances of the Episode class as separate variables.

    Create an array stored in a variable called episodes, and populate it with the three variables
    firstEpisode, secondEpisode and thirdEpisode. Watch the page populate itself automatically!
    Try changing the order in which you add the episodes, and watch what happens as it refreshes.
