            In this exercise, I have made some slight changes to our Episode class. As opposed to stating whether or not an episode has been watched when instantiating an episode, we now simply state the number of minutes that have been watched by the user, passing it as an argument to the constructor.
            There are two empty sets of parentheses in our if/else statement. Complete the conditions so that the class' hasBeenWatched property is correctly assigned. The first episode should show as "Already been watched," while the other two should show "Not yet watched."
