    Now that you've helped complete the show component, it's time to work on an individual episode component.
    This component will show the title of the episode, its duration (in minutes),
    and whether or not the user has already watched the episode.
    Create a variable called episodeTitle containing a string, and give your episode an exciting title.
    Create a number variable called episodeDuration, and decide how long your episode is in minutes.
    Finally, create a boolean variable called hasBeenWatched which states whether or not the user has already watched the episode.
    Check if the component works as you would expect it to. Don't hesitate to modify your values and see if the behavior is what you expect.
