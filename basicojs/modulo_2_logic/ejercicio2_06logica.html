    Let's make another modification to the logic in our  Episode  class. Your colleague's component now expects each episode to have the following properties:

    title  : a string containing the episode's title;

    duration  : a number, corresponding to the duration of the episode in minutes;

    watchedText  : a string containing either 'Not yet watched', 'Watching', or 'Watched' depending on how many minutes have been watched;

    continueWatching  : a boolean which is true if the user has started watching the episode but has not finished, and false otherwise.

You know what to do!

    Using one or more if/else statements, add the required logic to the Episode class constructor.

    Can you find a way to make your code shorter or easier to read?
