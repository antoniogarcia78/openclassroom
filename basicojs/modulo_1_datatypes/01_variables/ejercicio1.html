      // Create your variables here
// ==========================================
/*
You will create two variables which are needed by a component built by your colleague. 
Together, you are building the list view for TV shows, and each TV show needs a variable for the number of seasons that show has, and the number of episodes there are in each season.
Your colleague requests that you name these variables numberOfSeasons and numberOfEpisodes in order to be compatible with their code.
Create a variable called numberOfSeasons and assign it the value 6 between the lines created for you in the JavaScript editor (the tab labeled "JS").
Remember to use the let keyword, and don't forget the semicolon at the end of the line!
Next, create a variable called numberOfEpisodes, and assign it the value 12.
*/
let numberOfSeasons=5;
let numberOfEpisodes=10;

// ==========================================

let paragraph = document.querySelector('#info');
paragraph.innerText = `${numberOfSeasons} seasons, ${numberOfEpisodes} episodes per season`
